If any area in State Farm wants to develop microservice from scratch rapidly this tool will be really helpful.
As it provides the sceleton code for different layers.

In State Farm, most CI/CD pipeline heavily uses r2d2 CLI for different oprations like: appication
static scan, dynamic scan, dependecy scan, deployment. Is this tool flexible enough to generate 
CI/CD code which can include r2d2 CLI?
R2D2 CLI is State Farm developed Commandline tool for pipeline.

If a microservice uses Postgress database as backend and the database application id and password are stored
in vault, is the tool flexible enough to handle the scenerio?

Very much interested to see the capability for few patters like:
Microservice for Kafka
Microservice REST Proxy
Microservice Spring Proxy
